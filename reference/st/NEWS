                 RELEASE HISTORY OF THE "st" PACKAGE
               =======================================


		CHANGES IN `st' PACKAGE VERSION 1.1.4

- added option "group.method".  Now groups are determined either
  by the correlation neighborhood (possibly overlapping groups) or 
  by the clusters on the correlation graph (disjoint groups). 

		CHANGES IN `st' PACKAGE VERSION 1.1.3

- added option "group.thresh" to allow the specification of 
  correlation neighborhoods around features and the computation
  of the grouped cat score.

		CHANGES IN `st' PACKAGE VERSION 1.1.2

- correlation-shared t-statistic of Tibshirani and Wasserman 
  (2006) added: new functions cst.stat() and cst.fun().
- correlation-predicted t-statistic of Lai (2008) added:
  new functions lait.stat(), lait.fun() and lai.tscore().

		CHANGES IN `st' PACKAGE VERSION 1.1.1

- rankprod.stat() and rankprod.fun() added for calculation of the
  two-sided rank products statistic.
- reference to Zuber and Strimmer (2009) added.
- small corrections in the help pages, to pass the more stringent
  checks on .Rd files introduced in R in January 2009.


		CHANGES IN `st' PACKAGE VERSION 1.1.0

- new functions shrinkcat.stat() und shrinkcat.fun() implementing
  a shrinkage estimate of the "correlation-adjusted t-score" described
  in Zuber and Strimmer (2009).
- part of the code was rewritten to share code with the "sda" package 
  (exploiting the link between discriminant analysis and gene ranking). 


		CHANGES IN `st' PACKAGE VERSION 1.0.3

- the class labels can now be specified as arbitrary factors,
  the argument L is not any more restricted to be a vector containing
  only 1s and  2s.


		CHANGES IN `st' PACKAGE VERSION 1.0.2

- some corrections and extensions have been made in the documentation,
  in particular, how to compute q-values and local FDR values
- shrinkt() now returns a proper vector (one for which is.vector() is TRUE).
- the license was changed from "GNU GPL 2 or later" to "GNU GPL 3 or later".


		CHANGES IN `st' PACKAGE VERSION 1.0.1

- reference to Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer (2007) updated.
- updated email address
- updated minimum R versions and version of corpcor package


		CHANGES IN `st' PACKAGE VERSION 1.0.0


This is the first standalone release (31 August 2006).

This package implements the "shrinkage t" statistic described
in Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer (2007).  It also offers a convenient
interface to a number of other regularized t-type statistics often
used in high-dimensional case-control studies.
