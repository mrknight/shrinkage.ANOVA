              CHANGES IN `entropy' PACKAGE VERSION 1.0.0


This package implements the following estimators of entropy:

* the James-Stein shrinkage estimator by Hausser and Strimmer,
* the maximum likelihood estimator,
* the Miller-Madow estimator,
* various Bayesian estimators (based on Dirichlet-multinomial model),
* and the Chen-Shao estimator.

It also provides an R interface to the
*  Nemenman-Shafee-Bialek (NSB) estimator.

This is the first public release (2 September 2008).
